NYC Data Science April 24 Cohort


This repository contains all lectures for the April 24th 2023 Data Science Cohort.

### Getting access to your lectures

In order to connect to this repo, you will:

1. Fork this repository.
2. Clone your fork of this repository.
3. By the end of the previous step, you should have a pointer to the remote repository you just forked. The remote name should be called origin and will point to your forked repo.

When you type: git remote -v

You should see something like this:

If not, type: git remote add origin main <forked_git_repo_address>

4. As it stands your local repository is only connected to 

 git remote add upstream https://github.com/admveen/ORIGINAL_REPOSITORY.git


### Accessing the lectures

With the exception of the first two days of lectures, all lectures are in Jupyter notebook format and are meant to be viewed via the Jupyter RISE extension. In order to install this:

https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html

I would recommend the conda installation.
